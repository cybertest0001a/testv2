Hereâ€™s the updated script to include Windows Server 2003 and 2008 as obsolete:

```powershell
# Define obsolete versions for both clients and servers
$obsoleteVersions = @("5.2", "6.0", "6.1", "6.2", "6.3") # Server 2003 (5.2), Server 2008 (6.0), Windows 7 (6.1), Windows 8 (6.2), Server 2012 R2 (6.3)

# Retrieve all computers in the domain with their OS information
$computers = Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Property OperatingSystem, OperatingSystemVersion

# Check each computer for obsolete OS versions
foreach ($computer in $computers) {
    $osVersion = $computer.OperatingSystemVersion
    if ($obsoleteVersions -contains $osVersion) {
        Write-Output "Obsolete OS detected: $($computer.Name) is running version $osVersion"
    }
}
```

### Steps:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

2. **Import the Active Directory Module**:
   ```powershell
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Copy and paste the script into the PowerShell window to execute it.

### Notes:

- The script now includes checks for Windows Server 2003 (5.2) and Windows Server 2008 (6.0).
- Adjust the list of obsolete versions as needed based on your organization's policy.
