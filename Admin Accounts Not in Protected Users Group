To check the number of admin accounts not in the "Protected Users" group, you can use PowerShell. Here's how:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

2. **Import the Active Directory Module**:
   Ensure the Active Directory module is available.

   ```powershell
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory
   ```

3. **Get Admin Group Members**:
   Retrieve members of key administrative groups.

   ```powershell
   $adminGroups = @("Domain Admins", "Enterprise Admins")
   $adminMembers = @()

   foreach ($group in $adminGroups) {
       $members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $group -Recursive
       $adminMembers += $members
   }

   $adminMembers = $adminMembers | Select-Object -Unique
   ```

4. **Get Protected Users**:
   Retrieve members of the "Protected Users" group.

   ```powershell
   $protectedUsers = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Protected Users"
   ```

5. **Find Admins Not in Protected Users**:
   Compare the lists to find admin accounts not in the "Protected Users" group.

   ```powershell
   $adminsNotProtected = @()

   foreach ($admin in $adminMembers) {
       if (-not ($protectedUsers | Where-Object { $_.SamAccountName -eq $admin.SamAccountName })) {
           $adminsNotProtected += $admin
       }
   }

   $adminsNotProtected | Select-Object SamAccountName, Name
   ```

6. **Display Results**:
   Output the number and details of unprotected admin accounts.

   ```powershell
   $count = $adminsNotProtected.Count
   Write-Output "Number of admins not in Protected Users: $count"
   $adminsNotProtected | Format-Table SamAccountName, Name
   ```

This script will provide the count and details of administrative accounts that are not part of the "Protected Users" group. Adjust group names if necessary for your environment.
