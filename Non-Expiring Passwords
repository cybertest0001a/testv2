To check for accounts with non-expiring passwords in the Domain Admins group on Windows clients, you can use PowerShell. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

2. **Import the Active Directory Module**:
   Ensure the Active Directory module is available. If it's not, you might need to install the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT).

   ```powershell
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory
   ```

3. **Get Members of the Domain Admins Group**:
   Use the following command to list all members of the Domain Admins group.

   ```powershell
   $domainAdmins = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins"
   ```

4. **Check for Non-Expiring Passwords**:
   Iterate over each account and check if the password never expires.

   ```powershell
   $nonExpiringAccounts = @()

   foreach ($admin in $domainAdmins) {
       $user = Get-ADUser -Identity $admin.SamAccountName -Properties PasswordNeverExpires
       if ($user.PasswordNeverExpires) {
           $nonExpiringAccounts += $user
       }
   }

   $nonExpiringAccounts | Select-Object SamAccountName, Name
   ```

5. **Count and Display Results**:
   Display the count and details of accounts with non-expiring passwords.

   ```powershell
   $count = $nonExpiringAccounts.Count
   Write-Output "Number of accounts with non-expiring passwords: $count"
   $nonExpiringAccounts | Format-Table SamAccountName, Name
   ```

This script will output the number of accounts with non-expiring passwords and list their usernames and names. Adjust accordingly if you have specific requirements for the output format.
