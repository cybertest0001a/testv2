To check for excessive permissions on key domain objects, you can use PowerShell with the Active Directory module to analyze permissions. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

2. **Import the Active Directory Module**:
   ```powershell
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory
   ```

3. **Identify Key Domain Objects**:
   Determine which objects you want to check, such as Domain Controllers, critical groups, or organizational units (OUs).

4. **Check Permissions**:
   Use PowerShell to retrieve access control lists (ACLs) for these objects.

   ```powershell
   # Example for a key domain object, like "Domain Admins"
   $object = Get-ADGroup -Identity "Domain Admins"
   $acl = Get-ACL -Path ("AD:\" + $object.DistinguishedName)

   # Display permissions
   foreach ($ace in $acl.Access) {
       Write-Output "Identity: $($ace.IdentityReference) - Permissions: $($ace.ActiveDirectoryRights)"
   }
   ```

5. **Analyze Permissions**:
   Review the output to identify users or groups with potentially excessive permissions, such as `Write`, `FullControl`, or `Modify`.

### Notes:

- **Review Carefully**: Look for accounts that should not have elevated permissions.
- **Adjust as Needed**: Modify the script for different objects or permissions based on your security policies.
- **Security Tools**: Consider using security tools for a more comprehensive analysis of permission configurations. 

This approach provides a basic check and may need to be tailored to your environment's specific security requirements.
