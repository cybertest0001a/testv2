To check if WSUS is configured with unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS on a Windows client, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check Windows Update Registry Settings:**

   1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
   2. Type `regedit` and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
   3. Navigate to the following key:

      ```
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate
      ```

   4. Look for the value named `WUServer`.
   5. If the URL starts with `http://`, then WSUS is configured with unencrypted HTTP. If it starts with `https://`, it is using HTTPS.

2. **Use PowerShell:**

   You can also use PowerShell to check the configuration:

   ```powershell
   $wsusServer = Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate" -Name WUServer
   if ($wsusServer.WUServer -like "http://*") {
       Write-Host "WSUS is configured with unencrypted HTTP."
   } else {
       Write-Host "WSUS is configured with HTTPS."
   }
   ```

3. **Group Policy Editor (if applicable):**

   If your organization uses Group Policy to configure WSUS, you can check the settings:

   1. Press `Win + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press Enter.
   2. Navigate to:

      ```
      Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Update
      ```

   3. Look for the policy named **Specify intranet Microsoft update service location**.
   4. Check the URL specified. If it starts with `http://`, then itâ€™s using unencrypted HTTP.

These steps should help you determine whether WSUS is configured with HTTP or HTTPS on your Windows client.
