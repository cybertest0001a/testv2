To check when the Kerberos password was last changed, you can use PowerShell to query the domain controller. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

2. **Import the Active Directory Module**:
   Ensure the Active Directory module is available.

   ```powershell
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory
   ```

3. **Get the Krbtgt Account**:
   Retrieve the last password change date for the `krbtgt` account.

   ```powershell
   $krbtgt = Get-ADUser -Identity "krbtgt" -Properties PasswordLastSet
   ```

4. **Calculate Days Since Last Change**:
   Calculate the number of days since the password was last changed.

   ```powershell
   $lastChanged = $krbtgt.PasswordLastSet
   $daysSinceChange = (Get-Date) - $lastChanged
   $daysSinceChangeValue = [int]$daysSinceChange.TotalDays

   Write-Output "Last change of the Kerberos password: $daysSinceChangeValue day(s) ago"
   ```

This script will tell you how many days ago the Kerberos password was last changed. Adjust as necessary for your specific environment.
