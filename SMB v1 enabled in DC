To check if Domain Controllers are vulnerable to the SMB v1 vulnerability without using WinRM, you can use PowerShell locally on a Windows client. Here's how:

1. **PowerShell Script to Check SMB v1:**

   Run the following PowerShell command to check if SMB v1 is enabled:

   ```powershell
   Get-WindowsFeature -Name FS-SMB1
   ```

   If the `Display Name` shows `Installed`, then SMB v1 is enabled and potentially vulnerable.

2. **Registry Check:**

   You can also manually check the registry setting:

   1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter.
   2. Navigate to:

      ```
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
      ```

   3. Look for a value named `SMB1`. If it’s set to `1`, SMB v1 is enabled. If it’s `0` or missing, SMB v1 is disabled.

3. **Network Check Using PowerShell:**

   If you have network access to the Domain Controllers, you can remotely check if SMB v1 is enabled using PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   $servers = @("DC1", "DC2") # Replace with your domain controllers
   foreach ($server in $servers) {
       $result = Invoke-Command -ComputerName $server -ScriptBlock {
           (Get-SmbServerConfiguration).EnableSMB1Protocol
       }
       Write-Host "$server: SMB v1 Enabled = $result"
   }
   ```

   This script requires appropriate permissions and network access.

Make sure you have administrative privileges to run these commands and check these settings. If SMB v1 is enabled, it's recommended to disable it to mitigate vulnerabilities.
