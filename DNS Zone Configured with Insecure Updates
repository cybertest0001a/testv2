To check if a DNS zone is configured with insecure updates, you can use the `dnscmd` tool on a Windows client. Here's how:

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Command Prompt (Admin)`.

2. **Use `dnscmd` to Check Zone Properties**:
   Run the following command to see the configuration of a specific DNS zone:

   ```shell
   dnscmd /zoneinfo <ZoneName>
   ```

   Replace `<ZoneName>` with the name of the DNS zone you want to check.

3. **Review the Output**:
   Look for the "AllowUpdate" setting in the output:
   - `None`: No dynamic updates.
   - `Secure`: Only secure updates are allowed.
   - `Any`: Insecure updates are allowed.

If the output shows `Any`, the DNS zone is configured to allow insecure updates, which can pose a security risk.

### Notes:

- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run `dnscmd`.
- **Best Practices**: Configure DNS zones to allow only secure updates to enhance security.
