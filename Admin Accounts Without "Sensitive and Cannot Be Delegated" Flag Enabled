To check for admin accounts that do not have the "This account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" flag enabled, you can use PowerShell on a Windows client. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **PowerShell Script to Check Accounts:**

   Use the following PowerShell command to find admin accounts without the delegation flag:

   ```powershell
   # Get all admin accounts
   $adminAccounts = Get-ADUser -Filter 'AdminCount -eq 1' -Properties SamAccountName, UserAccountControl

   # Check for accounts without the 'sensitive and cannot be delegated' flag
   $vulnerableAccounts = $adminAccounts | Where-Object {
       -not($_.UserAccountControl -band 0x100000)
   }

   # Output accounts
   $vulnerableAccounts | Select-Object SamAccountName
   ```

2. **Explanation:**

   - The `AdminCount` property is typically set to `1` for administrative accounts.
   - The `UserAccountControl` flag `0x100000` (1048576 in decimal) indicates that the account is sensitive and cannot be delegated.
   - The script filters out accounts missing this flag.

3. **Prerequisites:**

   - Ensure you have the Active Directory PowerShell module installed.
   - Run the script with appropriate privileges to access Active Directory user properties.

This will list admin accounts that need the delegation protection flag enabled.
