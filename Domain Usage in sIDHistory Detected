To check for domains used in `sIDHistory`, you can use PowerShell to query Active Directory. Here's how to do it:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

2. **Import the Active Directory Module**:
   Ensure the Active Directory module is available.

   ```powershell
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory
   ```

3. **Search for sIDHistory Attributes**:
   Use the following script to find users or groups with `sIDHistory` set:

   ```powershell
   $sidHistoryAccounts = Get-ADUser -Filter {sIDHistory -ne "$null"} -Properties sIDHistory
   $sidHistoryAccounts += Get-ADGroup -Filter {sIDHistory -ne "$null"} -Properties sIDHistory

   foreach ($account in $sidHistoryAccounts) {
       Write-Output "Account with sIDHistory: $($account.SamAccountName)"
       foreach ($sid in $account.sIDHistory) {
           $domainSid = ($sid -split "-")[0..6] -join "-"
           Write-Output "Domain SID used in sIDHistory: $domainSid"
       }
   }
   ```

### Explanation:

- **Get-ADUser** and **Get-ADGroup**: Retrieves users and groups with `sIDHistory`.
- **sIDHistory**: Contains security identifiers from previous domains or forests.
- **Domain SID**: Extracted from the `sIDHistory` for analysis.

This script will list accounts with `sIDHistory` and display the domain SIDs being used. Adjust according to your needs and ensure you have appropriate permissions to query this information.
