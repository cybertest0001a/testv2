To check if service accounts with non-expiring passwords are domain administrators, you can use PowerShell. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

2. **Import the Active Directory Module**:
   Ensure the Active Directory module is available.

   ```powershell
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory
   ```

3. **Find Service Accounts with Non-Expiring Passwords**:
   Use the following script:

   ```powershell
   # Get all users with non-expiring passwords
   $nonExpiringAccounts = Get-ADUser -Filter {PasswordNeverExpires -eq $true} -Properties PasswordNeverExpires

   # Get members of the Domain Admins group
   $domainAdmins = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins"

   # Check which non-expiring accounts are domain admins
   $serviceAdminAccounts = $nonExpiringAccounts | Where-Object {
       $domainAdmins -contains $_
   }

   # Output the results
   $serviceAdminAccounts | Select-Object SamAccountName, Name
   ```

### Explanation

- **PasswordNeverExpires**: Filters users with passwords set to never expire.
- **Domain Admins**: Retrieves members of the Domain Admins group.
- **Comparison**: Identifies overlap between non-expiring accounts and domain admins.

This script will list service accounts with non-expiring passwords that are also domain administrators.
