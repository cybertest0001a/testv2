To check if the Print Spooler service is remotely accessible, you can use the following methods:

### Method 1: PowerShell Script

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator.**

2. **Run the following command to check if the Print Spooler service is running:**

   ```powershell
   Get-Service -Name Spooler
   ```

3. **Check Remote Accessibility:**

   Use the `Invoke-Command` to test remote accessibility:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-Command -ComputerName "YourDCName" -ScriptBlock {
       Get-Service -Name Spooler
   }
   ```

4. **Verify Firewall Rules:**

   Ensure that your firewall settings allow or block remote spooler access as needed:

   ```powershell
   Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like "*Spooler*" }
   ```

### Method 2: Group Policy

1. **Check Group Policy Settings:**
   
   - Open the Group Policy Management Console (`gpmc.msc`).
   - Navigate to **Computer Configuration** -> **Administrative Templates** -> **Printers**.
   - Look for settings related to "Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections" and ensure it is configured appropriately.

### Method 3: Network Scanning

1. **Use a Network Scanning Tool:**

   - Use tools like `nmap` to scan the network for open ports related to the Print Spooler service (port 445 for SMB, port 135 for RPC).

   ```bash
   nmap -p 445,135 YourDCName
   ```

### Method 4: Security Tools

- Use security tools like BloodHound to analyze permissions and access related to the Print Spooler service on your domain controllers.

### Mitigation

- **Disable Remote Printing:**
  If remote printing is not required, disable it via Group Policy or by stopping the Print Spooler service on the DC.

- **Firewall Rules:**
  Adjust firewall rules to restrict access to the Print Spooler service.

- **Regular Audits:**
  Perform regular audits to ensure the service is not inadvertently exposed.

Ensure you have administrative privileges and conduct these checks in compliance with your organization's security policies.
